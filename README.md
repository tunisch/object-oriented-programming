# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) — UML & Java Code

This project is prepared for the Patika.dev *Object-Oriented Programming* course and presents an example of a **UML class diagram** and **OOP design/implementation using Java**.

The repository currently contains the UML design. In future versions, it will be expanded by adding Java source code implementations.

---

## 🚀 Project Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Demonstrate object-oriented **design principles** using UML.
- Model class relationships such as *inheritance, association, aggregation, composition, etc*.
- Support the implementation of object-oriented structures using Java.
- Present a study that connects design with implementation.

## 📁 Project Structure

```md

The project is organized as follows:

📦 object-oriented-programming
┣ 📂 docs
┃ ┗ (Documentation and explanations)
┣ 📂 src
┃ ┗ (Java source code — to be added later)
┣ 📂 uml
┃ ┣ class-diagram.drawio ← Editable UML source
┃ ┗ class-diagram.png ← UML diagram image
┣ 📜 .gitignore
┗ 📜 README.md

```
---

## 📌 UML Diagram

The UML diagram is located in the uml/ directory:

- [class-diagram.drawio](uml/class-diagrams-draw.io)  → This file can be opened and edited using draw.io, diagrams.net, etc.
- [class-diagram.png](uml/class-diagrams-png)  → The visual representation of the UML diagram.

This diagram illustrates the relationships between classes and core OOP principles.

## 💡 OOP Concepts

Through the UML diagram and the Java code that will be added later, the following OOP concepts are demonstrated or will be demonstrated:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation (Kapsülleme)**
- **Inheritance (Kalıtım)**
- **Polymorphism (Çok Biçimlilik)**
- **Abstraction (Soyutlama)**
- **Association, Aggregation, Composition**
- **Interface ve Abstract Class Kullanımı**

(Detailed explanations will be listed here together with the code when implementations are added.)

--- 

## 🎯 Goal

This repository aims to teach OOP concepts not only theoretically, but through a complete workflow from
design (UML) → implementation (Java).

## 🛠 How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tunisch/object-oriented-programming.git
cd object-oriented-programming
```

### 2. Review the UML Diagram

[class-diagrams.png](uml/class-diagrams-png) Open the file `uml/class-diagram.png` to visually inspect the design.

### 3. Run the Java Code

When Java files are added under the `src/` directory:

```bash
javac src/*.java
java Main
```

> Note: The src/ directory is currently empty. These commands will work once Java source files are added.
